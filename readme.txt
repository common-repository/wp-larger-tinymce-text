This simple plugin makes the text larger and thus easier to read in the content editor.

== Description ==

This is a very simple plugin that just makes the text bigger in the TinyMCE editing iframe. Some websites I have built for schools/children were hard to contribute to simply because they found it difficult to read what was in the editor view as it was too small. It doesn't affect how the text is rendered on the page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-larger-tinymce-text.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it.

== Frequently asked questions ==

Does this make the text actually bigger in the rendered page?
No.
Does this plugin make the text in the editing area slightly easier to read for kids.
Yes.
